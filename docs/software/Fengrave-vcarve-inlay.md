## Vcarve inlay process using F-engrave ##

- Select the picture you want to use for your inlay
    - It is best to use a dxf or bmp file
    - It is better to use a black and white picture
    - The detail in the picture will determine its suitability for inlay work

- Prepare the picture for use with F-engrave
    - I use Inkscape or Gimp or plain old Windows Paint
    - You may have to do some work on simplifying the picture or enhancing the details
