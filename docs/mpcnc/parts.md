##Printed Parts

There are 3 different sets of printed parts C-23.5mm, F-25mm, or J-25.4mm (1in). The measurement is for the Outside 
Diameter of the conduit/rails/tubing. Please measure your rails before printing. 23.5mm fits 3/4″ EMT conduit in the 
US. Anywhere else you must physically measure first, some things are sold as Inside Dimension (ID) (conduit), or 
Outside Dimension (OD) (Tubing). Bummer

Steel hardware store EMT conduit works well and is inexpensive, an upgrade would be .049″ wall thickness stainless 
steel tubing (or thicker is fine as well). Stainless Steel tubing is more rigid and smooth, but also much more expensive.

Recommended Print Settings; PLA for dimension accuracy (PETG is also good, if your dimensions are verified good), 2 
or more perimeters for through hole strength. There are some steep walls so no more than 75% layer height to nozzle 
diameter, no support should be needed for any part I have designed.

***  The difference in the size of nuts requires some creative tightening if you don’t use #6’s on a few parts. A small flat head screw driver can usually be wedged in to stop the nuts from rotating if you have an issue.
