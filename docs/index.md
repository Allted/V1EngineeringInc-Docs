# V1 Engineering Documentation

This is the future home of the V1Engineering documentation (maybe).

Please wait to move actual v1engineering.com documentation over. It would be a real pain to do a lot
of that work and then find that this solution is not the right one in some way.

[This documentation is hosted on
github.io](https://v1engineeringinc.github.io/V1EngineeringInc-Docs)

[The source code is on github](https://github.com/V1EngineeringInc/V1EngineeringInc-Docs)

## Note

Most of these pages are just filler to play with navigation. The actual documentation is still at
[v1engineering.com](https://www.v1engineering.com/assembly/)

## Editing

I've put some info [here](mkdocs_info.md)

## Next Steps

We need a guide on making simple edits, then we need a few people of different skill sets to try
them out. If that all goes well, then we can decide on an initial layout and take volunteers to do
the formatting to convert the existing documentation over here, or volunteer to write new sections.
